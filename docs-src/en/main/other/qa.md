# Q&A

## Q: Columns changes don't take effect.
A: The table component internally watches columns without deep monitoring. Simply assign a new reference to columns. Refer to [Column Configuration](/en/main/api/stk-table-column)


## Q: dataSource changes don't take effect.
A: The same as columns. Simply assign a new reference to dataSource.
