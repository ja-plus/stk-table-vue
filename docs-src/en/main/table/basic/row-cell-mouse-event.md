# Row, Cell Hover and Select

## demo
<demo vue="basic/row-cell-mouse-event/RowCellHoverSelect.vue"></demo>

You can use `rowActive.disabled` to disable the selection function for specific rows.
::: warning Note
`rowActive.disabled`: The row cannot be selected by clicking. However, this row can still be selected through the `setCurrentRow` method.
:::

## Setting Current Row
You can select the current row by calling the component method [expose setCurrentRow](/en/main/api/expose.html#setcurrentrow)

## Setting Selected Cell
You can select the current cell by calling the component method [expose setSelectedCell](/en/main/api/expose.html#setselectedcell)
