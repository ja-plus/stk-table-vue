# 边框

::: tip
Configure `bordered` to implement table borders, with values `true` | `false` | `h` | `v` | `body-v`.

Due to scrollbar influence, the right and bottom borders of the table are implemented by cell's `border-right` and `border-bottom`, which may disappear. You can add custom CSS as needed.
